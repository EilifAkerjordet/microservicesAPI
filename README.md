# Microservices API using docker

Just a super simple microservice app, put together using docker and nginx. Simply a learning experience from my part, an attempt to better understand the technology.

Run cd web && npm run build && cd .. && docker-compuse up --build to access app on localhost:8080.

React frontend is not functioning as intended, but is it works. Working on fixing that.
